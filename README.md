# Monte Carlo Stock Price Simulation

This project is a **Monte Carlo simulation of stock prices** using C++ and live data fetched from **Yahoo Finance**. It demonstrates how to model stock price evolution using **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** and simulate potential outcomes for the next year.

## Features

- Fetches real-time stock prices via Yahoo Finance API.
- Simulates stock price evolution using Monte Carlo methods.
- Configurable parameters:
  - Initial stock price (`S0`)
  - Expected return (`mu`)
  - Volatility (`sigma`)
  - Time horizon (`T`)
  - Simulation steps and number of simulations.
- Outputs the **expected stock price** after 1 year.
